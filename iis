####Simple config information for IIS#########################


##If you deploy a new .NET app you will need to add the app pool user to the security of the folder

##deploy an app called dnn the app pool identity will be called 'dnn' unless you change it

##right click on the folder select the security tab and give IIS AppPool\dnn at least modify rights to the folder
###Make certain you are pointing to the local machine if you are on a domain joined system with the above command

###Or ICACLS
ICACLS d:\web\dnn /grant "IIS AppPool\dnn":F /t(for recursive)



#####STEP BY STEP############################
#Add data drive to server this is going to be where all apps are located
##Create a folder and remove inheritance
##Create sub-folders for each app
##Create a new site in IIS
##Add the IIS AppPool user to the folder i.e. "IIS AppPool\AppA
##*VERY IMPORTANT IF THE SERVER IS PART OF A DOMAIN THEN THE "WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION" IIS FEATURE MUST BE INSTALLED
##AND ENABLED FOR THIS TO WORK
##Test App


###### CHECK WHICH ACCOUNT ANONYMOUS USERS ARE USING TO CONNECT TO YOUR WEBSERVER###########
##Under IIS Manager click on your site/app then click on "Authentication" from there make certain
###Anonymous is set to 'enabled" and then double click to see what user account is being used
###Then make certain that user account has read rights to the above folder, or in my case
##One level above all my app folders


########MAKE CERTAIN THAT IF THE WINDOWS FIREWALL IS ON YOU ARE ALLOWING THE PORTS YOU NEED!!###########
