####My Experience with SailsJS #######
##REF: sailsjs.com#######


###Install#########
sudo npm install -g sails

##make a directory where you want your app
mkdir -p /home/user/api

cd api

sails new my-project

cd my-project

sails lift

###If everything is working right you should be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:1337###
###Note if you are using an headless Linux server you will need to run a reverse-proxy/loadbalancer like nginx###

####Now let's generate an api#######

###in the app directory in our case my-project###
sails generate api my-project

##Then visit http://localhost:1337/my-project



####################Connect SailsJS to a DB###################################

npm install --save sails-mongo  ###We are installing the mongo adapter there are many more available
###REF: https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-datastores
###REF: https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-datastores

##From the my-project folder
cd /config
####Note this is a change as of v1.0 from what I can see####
vim datastores.js

##Under defaults add your db connection

adapter: require('sails-mongo'),
    url: 'mongodb://mongo_DNS_OR_IP:27017/directory_db',
    

##If the database does not exists it will be created also note the above does not have a username or password

##Restart your app and go to /my-project and you should see '[]' 
##Simply insert documents into your mongodb and they will start showing up
