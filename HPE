#### Info regarding configuring blades, enclosures, etc.###

## HP OneView config#######

### Networks > Create A and B side for Ethernet and fibre channel##
## also we describe our VLANS here and we can also give the traffic
## a type i.e. Mgmt, VMotion###

##Then we create a Network Sets > which is a container for 
## your A, and B side so we group all our A vlans together
## all of our B vlans together 

##Next we add Logical interconnect groups(LIGS)
##LIGS have uplink sets which is our path out to the world whether it's 'Ethernet or FC' again we separate
##via A side, B side, A FC, B FC
##When creating our 'uplink sets' and pairing them with 'uplink ports' we use2 ports for 'A side'
##and then 2 ports for 'B side' i.e. 
##Ethernet uplink-A
## bay 1 Q1.1, Q1.2 B 
#Ethernet uplink-B
## bay 2 Q1.1, Q1.2
###This is using the 'HP VC FlexFabric-20/40 F8 Module'
##Note that we are using bay 1 for A side and bay 2 for B side

###Next we create an 'Enclosure Group' and pair it with our LIG and then as we add new C7000 enclosures
##we can just add the 'Enclosure Group' to it and it will inherit all of our network settings


##C7000 enclosure has 2 OA(Onboard Administrator) we need to configure these with an IP
##So we can begin configuration of our chasis note the OA is an Active/Passive pair you can
##configure this on the screen on the front of teh enclosure or directly console in and 
##and configure using CLI
