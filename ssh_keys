#########GENERATING SSH KEYS TO SSH INTO SERVERS#################################

ssh-keygen -t rsa
###You can also associate it with your email
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "me@me.com"(-C is for comments)
##Also you can use
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096(-b bits)
##then answer the presented questions#########
###you can enter a passphrase for your key if you like but if you do then you will need to enter it everytime you ssh into your server
######Once completed your keys should be in a location like this###
MAC - /Users/me/.ssh
LINUX - /home/me/.ssh
####File Names#####
id_rsa - private key this is the one you keep
id_rsa.pub - public key the one that gets uploaded to your server

####Copy ssh keys to server##################

ssh-copy-id user@123.45.56.78
##or###
ssh-copy-id -i /users/home/mykey.pub user@123.45.56.78(-i specifies the identity file to use default is /users/home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
###this should copy the keys to /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys

##You might have to use ssh-add 'your private key'

#######SSH BANNERS########################################
#Create a file called issue.net it can be located anywhere
sudo vim /etc/ssh/issue.net
###Add content to file then restart sshd
sudo systemctl restart sshd

##############SSH MOTD############################
sudo vim /etc/motd


####ADDING SSH KEYS TO SSH-AGENT###########
ssh-agent bash ##launch a bash shell for ssh-agent
ssh-add ##adds a private key to be managed
ssh-add /location/name_of_private_key ##add a non default key
ssh-add -l ##List all managed keys.

##REF:http://sshkeychain.sourceforge.net/mirrors/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO-6.html

##CHANGE SSH PORT########################
vi /etc/sshd_config  ##Make sure you are confuguring the correct file
##Find line 
#Port 22 and change to whatever make certain that port is free and that you allow it through the firewall
##iptables, firewalld, or ufw(ubuntu)

ssh user@server -p 1000

###Remove host from known_hosts#######

ssh-keygen -f "/home/user/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "host_DNS_OR_IP"


###Disable SSH host key checking

cd ~user/.ssh
touch config

##In the file add

Host *
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
   
 #The above will do this for all hosts VERY VERY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!
 
##You can do this

Host 192.168.1.5
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
   
 ##Just that host or
 
 Host 192.168.0.*
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
   
 ##The entire 192.168.0.0/24
 
 #####I haven't fully tested the above yet########
 ####REF:  https://www.shellhacks.com/disable-ssh-host-key-checking/
 
 
 ###Also I had an odd issue when I attempted to ssh into a server I kept getting asked to accept the key
 ###And everytime I accepted the key it would ask again, but it did tell me that the offending key
 ### in known_hosts was line 32, and the matching key was line 44, so I used vim and turned on number
 ### with 'esc' ':' 'set line' and deleted line 32 and now it's all happy
