#### Note I am just using the default config file located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default you can make it more fancy if you like


```Install Nginx```

````

sudo apt install -y nginx

sudo ufw status

````


```Generate diffie-helman file```


````
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096

````

```Create our conf files```


````

sudo touch /etc/nginx/snippets/certs.conf

sudo touch /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf


````

```Create dir to keep certs```


````

sudo mkdir /etc/pki/nginx
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/nginx/private

````

#### Populate our files

````
cat > /etc/nginx/snippets/certs.conf << __EOF__
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ng-self.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/certs/ng-key.key;

#### Check if our syntax is correct and restart nginx, also make any adjustments to the firewall if one is running

````

sudo nginx -t

sudo systemctl restart nginx

````

#### Once everything is working fine you can make one more adjustment where you have a 302 you can replace with a 301


````

return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;

sudo nginx -t

sudo systemctl restart nginx
