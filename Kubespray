sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

##you might have to upgrade pip if you are on a version < 10.0

# Copy ``inventory/sample`` as ``inventory/mycluster``
cp -rfp inventory/sample inventory/mycluster

# Review and change parameters under ``inventory/mycluster/group_vars``
cat inventory/mycluster/group_vars/all/all.yml
cat inventory/mycluster/group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml

# Also look at the addons.yml file to enable addons like metrics-server
/inventory/mycluser/group_vars/k8s-cluster/addons.yml

# Also in the below file you want to uncomment 'kube_read_only_port'
inventory/mycluster/group_vars/all/all.yml

# Update Ansible inventory file with inventory builder
declare -a IPS=(10.10.1.3 10.10.1.4 10.10.1.5)
CONFIG_FILE=inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml python3 contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py ${IPS[@]}

# Deploy Kubespray with Ansible Playbook - run the playbook as root
# The option `--become` is required, as for example writing SSL keys in /etc/,
# installing packages and interacting with various systemd daemons.
# Without --become the playbook will fail to run!
ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml  --become --become-user=root cluster.yml
