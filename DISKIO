##Higher the I/O size, bigger the throughput will be. On the revere size, IOPS will be lower whereas if the I/O 
##size is smaller you will get higher IOPS. Remember, the data is stored on the storage device in 
##size of 512 Bytes (Most common). It take a certain amount of time for storage device to read/write 
##single sector (512 Bytes for hard disk drives). I suggest that you read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format 
##to learn more about sector size.

##Now let’s say that you have read I/O request (operations) which is 8KB in size. To complete this request, 
##disk will have to read 16 sectors. As you can guess, it will take more time to read 16 sectors as compared to 1 
##sector from the disk drive. If we change the I/O request size to 64KB, 128 sectors will be read to complete the 
##request and it will take even more time as compared to complete 8KB size request.


Application Type	Access Pattern	Read %	Write %	Blocks (In KB)
Database (transaction processing)	Random	70	30	         8
Mail Server	                      Random	70	30	         8
File Copy (SMB)	                  Random	50	50	         64
Database (log ﬁle)	              Sequential	0	100	       64
Web Server	                      Random      0	100	       64 (***100% Writes?? shouldn't that be Reads??)
Backup	                          Sequential	0	100	       64
Restore	                          Sequential	100	0	       64


##I will add more info here as I get it#####
