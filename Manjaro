####Useful Manjaro commands############

##update system
sudo pacman -Syu

##install package#########
sudo pacman -S screenfetch


##To search the Manjaro repositories for available packages you can use the command pacman -Ss keyword. It will search both the package name and the description for the keyword. For example, to search for packages containing the keyword smplayer you could use:

pacman -Ss smplayer


##You can search your installed packages in the same manner using -Qs instead of -Ss. To search your installed packages for smplayer:

pacman -Qs smplayer


##Once you have found a package you can use pacman -Qi to get more information about an installed packages or pacman -Si for packages in the repos. Following the example above you could use

pacman -Si smplayer


##Finally, for a list of all installed packages on your system, enter the following command:

pacman -Ql


 ##Warning: Never install a package without updating the system first. On a rolling release this can lead to an unbootable system


###To install a software package, the basic syntax is pacman -S packagename. However, installing a package 
##without updating the system will lead to a partial upgrade situation so all the examples here 
##will use pacman -Syu packagename which will install the package and ensure the system is up to date. 
###For example, to sinatll smplayer the command is:

sudo pacman -Syu smplayer


##You will then be presented a list of software to install. You may notice 
##this list has more packages than you requested. This is because many packages also have dependencies 
##which are packages that must be installed in order for the software you selected to function properly.


##Pacman can also directly install packages from the local system or a location on the internet. 
##The format of that command is pacman -U packagelocation. For example, to install a copy of your package 
##cache you could do something like:

sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/smplayer-19.5.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

##Alternatively, you could get it directly from one of Manjaro's mirrors:

sudo pacman -U https://mirror.alpix.eu/manjaro/stable/community/x86_64/smplayer-19.5.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz


##Warning: When using pacman -U it is up to you to ensure that the package you are installing is fully compatible with your system.
