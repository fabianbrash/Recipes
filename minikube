minikube version

##The below will override minkubes default network which is 192.168.99.0/24 the thing is I actaully use
##that network on my network so it causes a ton of issues for me, if you don't let just leave it as is
##also this I think only works with virtualbox driver and of course you need to configure this in virtualbox first
