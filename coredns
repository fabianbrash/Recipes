####Working with CoreDNS
###So I had some challenges getting this up and running but I found a few blog post that helped me out
##REF:https://dev.to/robbmanes/running-coredns-as-a-dns-server-in-a-container-1d0
##REF:http://thefluffyadmin.net/?p=1427

##the first issue I had was a lot of Linux distros use systemd-resolved I am using photon OS and of course it does also
#so the first thing to do is

sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemct disable systemd-resolved

##the reason for this is it consumes udp 53 which you're container needs to run on
##the next issue I had was usually I can docker exec bash into a container, well this container is slim and I mean slim
##there is not bash no anything I kept getting an OCI erro when I attempted to run any exec commands
##so I had to use the below docker command

docker run -d -p 53:53/udp --rm --name coredns -v /static_content/coredns_config/:/root/ coredns/coredns -conf /root/Corefile

##again big help from the above blog postings

##Then the final issue I had was I'm pretty sure after you disable systemd-networkd you need to reboot photon OS
##our whatever flavor of linux because after changing the DNS server to itself again it's running the coredns container
##I couldn't get resolution, again a simple reboot fixed my issue
##Note I have 3 files in this repo to be modified for your specific use case the files are 
##Corefile, db.lab.io, and db.192.168.99

##But now I am finally free of having to always stand up a Windows VM for dns
