##First you need to download the tkg cli tool
#REF:https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=TKG-100&productId=988&rPId=45068

##Grab the photon OS from the above as well as the ova's I downloaded from the below did not work
##https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere
#Download the hap-proxy ova as well

##the tkg file is a .gz(why ooh why) so use gunzip to strip off the .gz
##tkg-linux-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1.gz will become tkg-linux-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1

mv tkg-linux-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1 tkg
sudo mv tkg /usr/local/bin

##the system you run this from must have kubectl and docker installed, you should know how to do that
##also the network that you deploy this into must have DHCP configured

tkg init --ui

##The above will launch a web browser to localhost:8080
##obvsiously select "Deploy on VSPHERE" and answer all the questions

##If everything went well you should now have a TKG management cluster now let's deploy a guest cluster

tkg create cluster tkg-cluster-0 --plan=dev --worker-machine-count=2

##for more options tkg create cluster --help

##Let's list our guest clusters
tkg get cluster


tkg get mc ## get mgmt cluster


##once done the 2 contexts will be merged(I'm not good with k8s contexts yet) if you need get the actual kube-config file
##ssh into the controller VM(s) ssh capv@1.1.1.1 then you can cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf again this is upstream k8s

##let's now scale our worker nodes
tkg scale cluster tkg-cluster-0 -w 5

##of course we can scale down
tkg scale cluster tkg-cluster-0 -w 1

###Note you must be @ the tkg-mgmt context to operate on tkg guests

##Now let's delete our guest cluster, again make sure you are @ the mgmt context
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context "context name"

##or you can use kubectx
#REF:https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx

tkg delete cluster tkg-cluster-0

###We can also delete the mgmt cluster

tkg delete management-cluster


###Context issues###

##So I consolidated my contexts and unfortunately I deleted the context file that TKG merged
##So in your home directory there is a .tkg folder and in there is a config.yaml file @ the end of the file
##is the name and path to config file that is being used, change it to the new file, but that's not all
##if you read the error message it's looking for a specific context name in the config file change the name
##to what its looking for, I have an example in my kubernetes recipe.

##Once I did those 2 things, things started to work again, but now I have to re-merge my config files with the new 
##changes so I can switch contexts(I hope it works)


##Learned you can also do this

tkg get credentials czdevtest(this is the name of the cluster) --export-file czdevtest.kubeconfig
