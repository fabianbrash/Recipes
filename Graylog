#####Graylog syslog server#############
##Home: https://www.graylog.org/
###Docker home: http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.4/pages/installation/docker.html

####Most of the config they have is correct or launching a docker container, excpet
###I had issues with elasticsearch and memory you have to run the following command in linux

sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

##The above worked on ubuntu, shoud work on centos and I will test on photonOS(sysctl is available 
###on photonOS so the above works)
##REF:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html

##The next issue I had was getting the web ui to show up, I kep getting an error message, so after looking
##around I found that it seems to be an issue binding to 0.0.0.0 so I placed the IP address like below and
### it worked for me.


docker run --link mongo --link elasticsearch \
    -p 9000:9000 -p 12201:12201 -p 514:514 \
    -e GRAYLOG_WEB_ENDPOINT_URI="http://69.55.62.56:9000/api" \
    -d graylog/graylog:2.4
    
    
###Note change your "GRAYLOG_WEB_ENDPOINT_URI" to whatever your public interface for a cloud node
###Or LAN for internal nodes to access

###Once you log in with admin admin, you will see an error about no nodes are configured to listening, I missed that part
####but after a while I run through the GUI seteup and set the node as a syslog TCP on port 514
##Also check the box for "Global"



####Setup Inputs###

#UDP

*.* @graylog.example.org:514;RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format

#TCP

*.* @@graylog.example.org:514;RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format

cd /etc/rsyslog.d

touch graylog.conf

##(The difference between UDP and TCP is using @ instead of @@ as target descriptor.)
##The above configuration should be placed as new file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ and rsyslog should be restarted.
##In addition the port 514 on the Graylog server need to be reachable from the sending server.
