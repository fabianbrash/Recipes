####I'll put infoo here in regards to Electricity###########

A x V = W(Apms x Volts = Watts)
1.5A x 50V = 
##Look at your input information on your Power Supplies####

##Also ask server/appliance vendors what's the average or peak AMPS a device will put out#######

###Also check power cords to see what they are rated @ if the power cord maxes at 120V and you push
##240V you'll melt the wire

##Also check your power supply to see the highest Volts it can handle, must modern PSU's can handle####
##120-240V

A typical PDU designed to be hooked up to a 30 amp circuit would be able to handle about 5,000 watts at 208 volts. 

5,000 watts / 208 volts = approx. 24 amps, which is 80% of the 30 amp circuit. Eighty percent is where you cap it to keep from tripping circuits or overheating wires. 

The PDU would typically come with a L6-30 P male plug, which would connect to a L6- 30 R receptacle. 

 Each server should have a power rating, and it should be considerably less than what the power supply is actually rated for. Servers are quite often around 1,000 watts or less.
