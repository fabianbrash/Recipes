##let's give everyone read access to a file###

chmod 644 file.log

###########Permission desciptors###################

Number     Permission Type               Symbol
0	         No Permission	               ---
1	         Execute	                     --x
2	         Write	                       -w-
3	         Execute + Write	             -wx
4	         Read	                         r--
5	         Read + Execute	               r-x
6	         Read +Write	                 rw-
7	         Read + Write +Execute	       rwx


##So from the above of chmod 644 file.log

##So 6 = rw for the user, 4 = Read for the group, 4 = Read for everyone

##and from the above chmod 644 file.log since we are not specifying anyone then it's for the current user
##for me this is root because that's who I am logged into at the moment############


###Now let's remove read permissions from everyone#####
chmod 640 file.log
