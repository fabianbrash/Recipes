##############PERMISSIONS FOR FOLDER REDIRECTION#############################

#These are the two steps I was most interested in finding:

##Set Share Permissions for the Everyone group to Full Control.

##Use the following settings for NTFS Permissions:

##CREATOR OWNER - Full Control (Apply onto: Subfolders and Files Only)
##System - Full Control (Apply onto: This Folder, Subfolders and Files)
##Domain Admins - Full Control (Apply onto: This Folder, Subfolders and Files)
##Everyone - Create Folder/Append Data (Apply onto: This Folder Only)
##Everyone - List Folder/Read Data (Apply onto: This Folder Only)
##Everyone - Read Attributes (Apply onto: This Folder Only)
##Everyone - Traverse Folder/Execute File (Apply onto: This Folder Only)


#Pay attention when configuring the home directory or folder redirection policies.  If you enable the setting to give the user 
#exclusive access to the folder, you will override the inherited permissions and need to reset the ACL.
