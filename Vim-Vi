#####WHILE WORKING WITH .YAML FILES I RECEIVED THE BELOW ERROR MESSAGE##########
#######yaml: line 43: found character that cannot start any token###
###THE CAUSE WAS TABS WERE INSERTED IN THE FILE AND .YAML WANTS SPACES SO I HAD TO DO
###ESC : set list so I could see the TABS which is showed up as ^I while spaces were $ so I simply jsut deleted
###The ^I and I was good, I need to find a way to find and replace them all
