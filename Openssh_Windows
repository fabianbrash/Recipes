##On server 2019 you can install ssh server the client is installed by default by going to


Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0

##Install the server

Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0

Set-Service -Name ssh-agent -StartupType ‘Automatic’
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType ‘Automatic’

Start-Service ssh-agent
Start-Service sshd

##You can also install the below

Install-Module -Force OpenSSHUtils -Scope AllUsers

##Which will give you a few tools like
Repair-AuthorizedKeyPermission 
##But apparently the above does not work properly and you still need to manually assign the correct permissions

##so you can do this 
Repair-AuthorizedKeyPermission C:\users\Chancellor\.ssh\authorized_keys
Icacls authorized_keys /remove “NT SERVICE\sshd”

##And the above should give the correct permissions to your keys file

##Now if you want to use keys

##if the user is in the local administrators group then create the authorized_keys file under C:\ProgramData\ssh\ and the file is 
##not called authorized_keys but administrators_authorized_keys(WWHATTT!!!!)
##then you have to remove inheritance and grant only SYSTEM and Administrators Full control of the file.

#Also check C:\PrograData\ssh\ssh_config and make certain the belwo is not commented
